[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that they have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use their contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When submiting a pull request, the [GitHub CLA Bot](https://github.com/apps/cla-bot) is used to: (a) automatically determine whether a CLA is required; and (b) decorate the pull request appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Following the CLA instructions provided by the bot is required once across all repositories using our CLA.
