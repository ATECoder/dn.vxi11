/// <see cref="Vxi11Server"/> and the 'physical'
/// <see cref="Vxi11Instrument"/>.
/// 
/// Implementations of VXI-11 servers should inherit from the <see cref="Vxi11Instrument"/> and,
/// perhaps also, from the <see cref="Vxi11Device"/>.
/// 
/// Instrument classes inheriting from the <see cref="Vxi11Instrument"/> might override a few
/// methods as necessary for implementing the designed behavior.
/// 
/// The <see cref="Vxi11Server"/> and <see cref="Vxi11Device"/> classes implement the device_xxx
/// remote procedure calls as specified in the
/// <see href="https://vxibus.org/specifications.html">VXI-11 TCP/IP Instrument Protocol
/// Specification</see> VXI-11 Version 1.0 document.
