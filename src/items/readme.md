# About

[ISR's VXI11] is a control and communication library for LXI-based instruments. 

## History

[ISR's VXI11] is a is a fork of [VXI11.CSharp], which uses [GB1.RemoteTea.Net], which is a pure C# implementation of ONC/RPC. 
[RemoteTea.Net] is a port of the pure Java RemoteTea package. 

## Standards

* [XDR: External Data Representation Standard (May 2006)]
* Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC)
	* [RPC: Remote Procedure Call Protocol Specification Version 2 (May 2009)]
	* [Binding Protocols for ONC RPC Version 2 (August 1995)]
* [VXI Bus Specification]

## How to Use

For information on using [ISR's VXI11] see the repository [ISR's VXI11 IEEE488] projects.

## Departures from [VXI11.CSharp]

* The XDR and ONC/RPC classes were removed in favor of using [ISR's XDR] and [ISR's ONC RPC] packages;
* The base namespace was changed to cc.isr;
* The VXI11 namespace was changed to cc.isr.VXI11;
* The casing of namespace suffices, such as server and web, were changed to Pascal.
* Pascal case naming convention is used for classes, methods and properties;
* Interface names are prefixed with 'I';
* Base class names are suffixes with Base;
* the xdrAble interface was renamed to IXdrCodec;
* The xdr prefixes were removed from the codec methods;
* Uppercase constant names were converted to Pascal casing while retaining the original constant names in the code documentation;
* The namespace of the ONC/REPC client classes was changed fro isr.cc.ONC.RPC.Clients;
* Getters and setters, such as Get and Set Character Encoding, where changed to properties where possible.
* Static constant classes where converted to Enum constructs.
