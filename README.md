#### Description

[ISR's VXI-11] is a partial C### implementation of the [VXI Bus Specification].

#### History

[ISR's VXI-11] is a is a fork of [VXI11.CSharp].

[ISR's VXI-11] uses [ISR's ONC RPC], which is a C### implementation of the [Sun RPC] ported from the [Java ONC RPC] implementation termed Remote Tea.

[ISR's ONC RPC] is a fork of [GB1.RemoteTea.Net], which was forked from [Wes Day's RemoteTea.Net], which is a fork of [Jay Walter's SourceForge repository], which is a port of [Java ONC RPC] as documented in [org.acplt.oncrpc package].

[ISR's ONC RPC] uses [ISR's XDR], which is a C### implementation of the [XDR: External Data Representation Standard (May 2006)] as implemented in [Java ONC RPC] implementation called Remote Tea. [ISR's XDR] was split off from [GB1.RemoteTea.Net].


##### On the agenda
The following items has yet to be implemented:
* Device Clear;
* read Service Request register;
* Enable and register service call backs.

#### Issues

#### Supported .NET Releases

#### Source Code
Clone the repository along with its requisite repositories to their respective relative path.

##### Repositories
The repositories listed in [external repositories] are required:
* [IDE Repository] - IDE support files.
* [ISR'S XDR] - eXternal Data Representation.
* [ISR'S ONC RPC] - ONC/RPC.
* [ISR'S VXI-11] - VXI-11.

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:davidhary/vs.ide.git
git clone https://github.com/ATECoder/dn.xdr.git
git clone https://github.com/ATECoder/dn.onc.rpc.git
git clone https://github.com/ATECoder/dn.vxi11.git
```

Clone the repositories into the following folders (parents of the .git folder):
```
%vslib%\core\ide
%dnlib%\iot\xdr
%dnlib%\iot\oncrpc
%dnlib%\iot\vxi
```
where %dnlib% and %vslib% are  the root folders of the .NET libraries, e.g., %my%\lib\vs 
and %my%\libraries\vs, respectively, and %my% is the root folder of the .NET solutions

##### Global Configuration Files
ISR libraries use a global editor configuration file and a global test Runs settings file. 
These files can be found in the [IDE Repository].

Restoring Editor Configuration:
```
xcopy /Y %my%\.editorconfig %my%\.editorconfig.bak
xcopy /Y %vslib%\core\ide\code\.editorconfig %my%\.editorconfig
```

Restoring Runs Settings:
```
xcopy /Y %userprofile%\.runsettings %userprofile%\.runsettings.bak
xcopy /Y %vslib%\core\ide\code\.runsettings %userprofile%\.runsettings
```
where %userprofile% is the root user folder.
