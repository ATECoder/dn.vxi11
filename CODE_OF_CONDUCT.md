### Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) to clarify expected behavior in our community.

Community Impact Guidelines are inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

Expanding scope to include external impact on community health is inspired by [Facebook's Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.facebook.com/code-of-conduct) and [Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).

For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the [Contributor Covenant FAQ](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq). For translations see [Contributor Covenant Translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations).
